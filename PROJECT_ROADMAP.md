# AutomatedBots.ai Pipeline Visualizer - Project Roadmap

## üéØ Project Overview

**Main Goal:** Create a lead magnet web app for an AI automation agency that visualizes business pipeline bottlenecks and showcases automation opportunities.

**Business Context:**
- Company: AI Automation Agency
- Target Audience: Business owners who want to use AI but don't know where to start
- Domain: automatedbots.ai (already purchased)
- Launch Timeline: 2 days from project start

## üìã Current Status

**MVP Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- 3D pipeline visualization working perfectly locally
- Interactive tabs (Marketing, Sales, Onboarding, Fulfillment, Retention)
- Thought bubbles with automation suggestions
- Lead capture form functional
- Built with: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Three.js, GSAP

**What Works:**
- 3D pipeline renders correctly
- Camera zooms to different sections
- Interactive sliders adjust pipeline capacities
- Bottleneck detection and visualization
- Current/Optimized scenario toggle
- Lead capture form with business challenge dropdown

## ‚úÖ Next Steps (Lean Path)

These are the highest‚Äëleverage actions to turn the visualizer into a strong lead magnet now, stabilize the codebase, and package services for revenue. Use the checkboxes to track progress.

### 1) Lead‚Äëgen upgrades (1‚Äì2 weeks)
- [ ] Personalized PDF report (gated)
  - Auto-generate from current inputs: bottleneck, current vs optimized ARR, recommended automations per stage
  - Deliver on form submit; store a copy/link in Airtable
- [ ] Calendar integration
  - Show booking modal after successful submit; add booking intent/status to Airtable
- [ ] Lead scoring in Airtable
  - Score = weighted sum of: slider changes, tabs visited, time on page, scenario toggles
  - Persist interaction depth fields (e.g., `tabsVisited`, `totalSliderAdjustments`, `scenarioSelected`)
- [ ] Simple ROI inputs
  - Make client value and close rate editable; recalc revenue and copy live
- [ ] Dynamic copy surfacing ROI
  - Emphasize per‚Äëstage ROI multipliers inside process copy and overlays

Acceptance criteria:
- PDF download works and matches brand; record is created in Airtable with pipeline data and user journey
- Post‚Äësubmit modal offers calendar booking; UTM/source carried into Airtable

### 2) Light refactor (2‚Äì3 weeks)
- [ ] Unify Three.js imports
  - Remove CDN scripts from `index.html`; import `three` via ESM; align helper libs (`three-spritetext`) to same version
- [ ] Module boundaries for UI logic
  - Split `UIController` into: `TutorialManager`, `OverlayManager`, `FormController`; keep `SceneManager` thin
- [ ] Remove `window.*` globals
  - Replace with React Context or a small store (e.g., `usePipeline()` with Context/zustand) and component event handlers
- [ ] Stronger types
  - Introduce TypeScript (or JSDoc typedefs) for `BusinessData`, `ProcessId`, `StageConfig`, camera configs
- [ ] Single source of truth for state
  - Keep `businessData` in the store; DOM reads only for rendering; centralize DOMHelpers usage
- [ ] Reliability fixes
  - Fix `ErrorHandler` fallback reference to camera positions; standardize GSAP transition cleanup
- [ ] DX
  - Add lint/format and a couple of smoke tests (renderer init; camera transition returns true)

Acceptance criteria:
- App runs without global `THREE`/`gsap` reliance; transitions work; no `window.*` APIs required by UI
- Basic tests pass in CI; lints clean

### 3) Offers to productize now (packages)
