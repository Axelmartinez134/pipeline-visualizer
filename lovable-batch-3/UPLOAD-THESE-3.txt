🚨 BATCH 3 - CRITICAL MISSING FILES
====================================

UPLOAD THESE 3 FILES TO LOVABLE NOW
------------------------------------

These files are imported by the files you already uploaded:

1. 3d-components-ThoughtBubbles.js
   → Imported by SceneManager.js
   → Creates HTML overlay bubbles (even if hidden)

2. 3d-constants-processContent.js
   → Imported by UIController.js  
   → Contains process automation content

3. esmSetup.js
   → Sets up window.THREE and window.gsap globals
   → Required for the 3D system to work


📤 UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------------

In Lovable, upload these 3 files and say:

---

I'm uploading 3 more critical files that are imported by the files already uploaded:

1. ThoughtBubbles.js - imported by SceneManager
2. processContent.js - imported by UIController  
3. esmSetup.js - sets up THREE.js and GSAP globals

These complete all the dependencies. You now have everything needed (25 files total).

Please proceed with implementing SimplifiedPipelineDemo!
