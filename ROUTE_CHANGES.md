## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `ROUTE_CHANGES.md` (this documentation)
- `src/EmbedApp.jsx` (embed page component)
- `src/EmbedApp.css` (embed page styles)
- `src/3d/constants/embedBusinessData.js` (embed business data)
- `src/3d/constants/embedProcessContent.js` (embed process content)

### Modified Files:
- `src/main.jsx` (added URL routing logic)

### Unchanged Files:
- All original files preserved
- Original App.jsx and App.css untouched
- All 3D pipeline code reused (not duplicated)

---

## Technical Implementation Details

### Routing Approach:
- Used Option B (Simple URL Detection)
- No React Router dependency added
- Lightweight implementation (~10 lines of code)

### Code Reuse Strategy:
- 3D pipeline code fully reused (no duplication)
- Separate data files for customization
- Clean separation of concerns

### Iframe Optimization:
- White background for clean embedding
- Minimal padding/margins
- Responsive design for various iframe sizes

---

## Next Steps for Future Development:

1. **Customize Embed Content:** Update embedBusinessData.js and embedProcessContent.js with business-specific copy
2. **Add Case Studies:** Create additional routes when ready (around 4-5 pages, consider React Router migration)
3. **SEO Optimization:** Add specific meta tags for embed page if needed
4. **Analytics:** Consider separate tracking for embed page usage

---

## Developer Notes:

- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Original app functionality completely preserved
- Embed page uses same 3D engine for consistency
- Easy to migrate to React Router when needed
- Documentation updated for future developers

## Tutorial System Customization

### Issue: Tutorial System Not Wanted on Embed
**Problem**: Tutorial system was causing unwanted behaviors on embed page:
1. Yellow highlighting on page load (from `highlightTabs: true`)
2. Wrong content appearing after tutorial button click (switching to business analysis mode)
3. User didn't want any tutorial steps at all on embed page

**Root Cause**: Tutorial system has automatic highlighting and content switching that wasn't appropriate for clean embed interface.

**Solution Applied**:
- Completely disable tutorial system for embed page
- Set `tutorialState.isActive = false` and `completed = true`
- Remove any tutorial highlights immediately
- Force to normal educational overlay mode for clean text boxes
- Keep educational overlays available for future customization

**Files Modified**:
- `src/3d/embedIndex.js`: Disabled tutorial system entirely for embed version

**Result**: Embed page now has clean interface with no tutorial, no highlighting, just customizable text boxes

### Issue: Invisible White Tabs on Embed Page
**Problem**: The 5 tab buttons (Marketing, Sales, Onboarding, Fulfillment, Retention, Overview) were appearing pure white and invisible against the white embed page background.

**Root Cause**: 
- Overview tab was set as active by default on page load
- Active tabs had `background: white` styling from original app
- White tabs on white background = invisible

**Solution Applied**:
- Modified `.tab.active` CSS in `src/EmbedApp.css`
- Changed active tab background from white to solid blue (`#1E3A8A`)
- Added blue shadow and subtle transform for better visual feedback
- Maintained white text for good contrast
- **Additional Fix**: Added aggressive inline style cleanup in `src/3d/embedIndex.js`
- Force remove any tutorial highlighting inline styles that override CSS

**Root Cause Update**: Tutorial system applies inline styles (like `style="background: rgba(255, 193, 7, 0.2)"`) which have higher priority than CSS classes, making tabs appear white/invisible.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/EmbedApp.css`: Updated active tab styling for visibility
- `src/3d/embedIndex.js`: Added forced cleanup of tutorial inline styles

**Result**: All tabs now clearly visible with proper active/inactive states on white background
