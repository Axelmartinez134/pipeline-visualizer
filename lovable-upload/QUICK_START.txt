🚀 QUICK START GUIDE FOR LOVABLE
==================================

STEP 1: Upload This Folder
---------------------------
Upload the entire "lovable-upload" folder to Lovable.
All 30 files are needed for context.


STEP 2: Give Lovable This Prompt
---------------------------------
Copy and paste this into Lovable:

---

I need you to create a SimplifiedPipelineDemo component using these files as reference.

**Context:** These files are flattened from a nested folder structure. The naming convention is:
- 3d-core-UIController.js → originally at src/3d/core/UIController.js
- features-visualizer-PipelineVisualizer.tsx → originally at src/features/visualizer/PipelineVisualizer.tsx

**Task:** Read the complete instructions in README-FOR-LOVABLE.md and create the SimplifiedPipelineDemo component.

**Key Requirements:**
1. Create: src/components/SimplifiedPipelineDemo.jsx (new file)
2. Modify: src/3d/components/Camera.js (lock camera to overview)
3. Modify: src/3d/components/Pipeline.js (remove water flow)
4. Modify: src/3d/core/UIController.js (disable tutorial)
5. Create: src/components/SimplifiedPipelineDemo.css (optional - can reuse App.css)

**What it should do:**
- Show 3D pipeline at locked overview position
- Two buttons: "Current State" and "See After Automation"
- 3-click manual sequence (button fills progressively)
- No tabs, sliders, form, or extra UI
- Mobile + Desktop responsive

Please read README-FOR-LOVABLE.md for complete details, then implement the SimplifiedPipelineDemo component.

STEP 3: Let Lovable Work
-------------------------
Lovable will:
✓ Read the README instructions
✓ Analyze the existing code
✓ Create the new component
✓ Modify the necessary files
✓ Test the implementation


STEP 4: Review & Test
----------------------
After Lovable creates the component, test:
- [ ] Pipeline loads at overview (camera doesn't move)
- [ ] Stage labels visible
- [ ] No water animations
- [ ] "See After Automation" 3-click sequence works
- [ ] Pill fills 33% → 66% → 100%
- [ ] "Current State" resets everything
- [ ] Works on mobile


STEP 5: Integrate Into Your Site
---------------------------------
Import the component wherever you want:

```jsx
import SimplifiedPipelineDemo from './components/SimplifiedPipelineDemo';

function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <SimplifiedPipelineDemo />
      {/* Your other content */}
    </div>
  );
}
```


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
If Lovable has questions:
- Refer it back to README-FOR-LOVABLE.md
- App.jsx has reference patterns for buttons
- UIController.js has the switchScenario() logic
- Pipeline.js has the pipe rendering logic


IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------
✅ All 30 files are needed for context
✅ README-FOR-LOVABLE.md has complete instructions
✅ Flattened names preserve original paths
✅ Only 3 files need modification (Camera, Pipeline, UIController)
✅ 1 new file needs creation (SimplifiedPipelineDemo.jsx)


That's it! Good luck! 🎯
