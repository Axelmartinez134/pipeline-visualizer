🎯 UPLOAD THESE FILES TO LOVABLE AND SAY THIS:
===================================================

I'm uploading the missing Educational Overlays component that the OverlayManager.js needs.

THE ISSUE:
- OverlayManager.js has logic to update overlays
- But the actual HTML elements don't exist in the DOM
- Result: Wrong overlay appears (thought bubbles instead of bottleneck list)

THE FIX:
I'm uploading 3 files:
1. EducationalOverlays.jsx - React component with overlay HTML
2. EducationalOverlays.css - Complete styling
3. INTEGRATION-INSTRUCTIONS.md - Step-by-step integration guide

WHAT TO DO:
1. Add EducationalOverlays.jsx and .css to src/components/
2. Import EducationalOverlays in SimplifiedPipelineDemo.jsx
3. Render <EducationalOverlays /> inside the pipeline-container div
4. Initialize overlays after 3D system loads (see instructions)

RESULT:
The bottom overlay will show "Your Highest-Priority Bottlenecks: 1. Fulfillment, 2., 3." with a red triangle pointing to the bottleneck stage. This is the CORRECT overlay (not the process-specific thought bubbles).

Please read INTEGRATION-INSTRUCTIONS.md for complete step-by-step guidance. Follow those steps exactly to integrate the overlays into SimplifiedPipelineDemo.

The overlays will then work with the existing OverlayManager.js logic to display bottleneck priorities correctly.
