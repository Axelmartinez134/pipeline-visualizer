🚀 LOVABLE 10-FILE UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS
========================================

📁 THIS FOLDER CONTAINS THE 10 MOST ESSENTIAL FILES
----------------------------------------------------

You're uploading these 10 files because Lovable has a file limit.
These are the CORE files needed to create the SimplifiedPipelineDemo component.


📋 WHAT'S INCLUDED (10 FILES)
------------------------------

1. README-FOR-LOVABLE.md ← COMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS (read this first!)
2. App.jsx ← Reference for button patterns
3. App.css ← Styles to reuse
4. package.json ← Dependencies
5. 3d-components-Pipeline.js ← Pipe rendering (needs modification)
6. 3d-components-Camera.js ← Camera logic (needs modification)
7. 3d-core-UIController.js ← UI logic (needs modification)
8. 3d-constants-businessData.js ← Default values
9. features-visualizer-VisualizerContext.tsx ← Context hooks
10. features-visualizer-PipelineVisualizer.tsx ← Canvas wrapper


📤 UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------------

STEP 1: Upload all 10 files to Lovable

STEP 2: Use this prompt:

---

I'm uploading 10 core files from a React/Three.js pipeline visualizer. These files use flattened naming (e.g., "3d-core-UIController.js" was at "src/3d/core/UIController.js").

Please read README-FOR-LOVABLE.md carefully for complete instructions.

TASK: Create SimplifiedPipelineDemo component

FILES TO CREATE:
- src/components/SimplifiedPipelineDemo.jsx (new component)

FILES TO MODIFY:
- src/3d/components/Camera.js (lock camera to overview)
- src/3d/components/Pipeline.js (remove water flow animations)
- src/3d/core/UIController.js (disable tutorial system)

KEY REQUIREMENTS:
- 3D pipeline with LOCKED camera (always at overview, never moves)
- Two buttons: "Current State" and "See After Automation"
- 3-click sequence with pill progress (0% → 33% → 66% → 100%)
- Stage labels visible (Marketing, Sales, Onboarding, Fulfillment, Retention)
- NO tabs, sliders, form, zoom, play/pause, overlays, tutorial, or water animations
- Mobile + Desktop responsive
- Reuse existing 3D system (don't rebuild)

The README has all implementation details including:
- Exact button code to reuse from App.jsx
- How to lock the camera
- How to remove water flow
- How to disable tutorial
- Complete technical specifications

Please read the README first, then implement the component following those instructions.

---


🔍 IF LOVABLE ASKS FOR MORE CONTEXT
------------------------------------

Tell Lovable:
"The other supporting files (SceneManager, Lighting, etc.) are used internally but don't need modification. Focus on the 3 files that need changes: Camera.js, Pipeline.js, and UIController.js. All the logic you need is in these 10 files plus the README instructions."


💡 KEY POINTS TO EMPHASIZE
---------------------------

1. README-FOR-LOVABLE.md has COMPLETE implementation details
2. App.jsx shows the EXACT button patterns to copy
3. Only 3 files need modification (Camera, Pipeline, UIController)
4. The component should REUSE the existing 3D system
5. Camera must be LOCKED to overview (never move)
6. No water flow animations (static pipes)


✅ WHAT LOVABLE WILL CREATE
----------------------------

After reading the README, Lovable will:
✓ Create SimplifiedPipelineDemo.jsx component
✓ Lock camera in Camera.js
✓ Remove water in Pipeline.js
✓ Disable tutorial in UIController.js
✓ Test the implementation


🎯 EXPECTED RESULT
-------------------

A working component that:
- Shows 3D pipeline at overview (locked camera)
- Has two buttons that toggle scenarios
- 3-click sequence fills button progressively
- Works on mobile and desktop
- Can be imported: import SimplifiedPipelineDemo from './components/SimplifiedPipelineDemo'


📞 TROUBLESHOOTING
-------------------

If Lovable says "I need more files":
→ Point it to specific sections in the README
→ The README has code examples for everything

If Lovable asks about file structure:
→ Tell it the flattened names represent nested paths
→ Example: 3d-core-UIController.js → src/3d/core/UIController.js

If Lovable asks about dependencies:
→ They're all in package.json (React, Three.js, GSAP, etc.)


That's it! Upload these 10 files and use the prompt above. 🚀
